/**

 *
 * DNR conflict resolver for cross-source rule priorities.
 *
 * When multiple sources (static rulesets, dynamic rules, session rules,
 * user rules) define overlapping or conflicting rules, this resolver
 * establishes precedence and produces a merged effective rule set.
 *
 * Precedence (highest to lowest):
 *   session rules > dynamic rules > static rulesets > user allow/block
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { DnrConflictResolver } from "./dnr-conflict-resolver.js";
 *   const merged = DnrConflictResolver.merge([staticRules, dynamicRules, sessionRules]);
